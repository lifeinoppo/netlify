It’s been a few years since we cut cable, so we mostly watch Netflix shows these days—not like we have many other options anyway.

Hulu isn’t available in Brazil; HBO Now (oddly called HBO Go in here) is a mess and the streaming quality is incredibly poor; Amazon Prime catalog is plain depressing; And piracy is not an option for us. Besides, efficiency and convenience _always_ win in the end.

With that being said, 99% of what’s listed below are on Netflix.
